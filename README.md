# Donation App

By <a href="http://jrliv.com/about/" target="_blank">Jae Logan</a>

## Description

This is a simple WPF desktop application that I made for fun. It allows you to enter a donation amount and your name. When you click the Donate button, the donation amount after expenses and the total amount of donations raised are calculated and displayed.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it so I included the executable file. If you're using Windows and you just want to run and play with it you can download and run <a href="https://github.com/jrliv/DonationApp/blob/master/DonationApp/bin/Debug/DonationApp.exe" target="_blank">the executable</a>.
